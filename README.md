# My Personal JavaScript Styleguide

My personal JavaScript styleguide derives mainly from the [AirBnb JS rule book](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some little tweeks which are denoted in the repository.

## Usage

    },
    "eslintConfig": {
        "extends": [
            "eslint-config-matchilling"
        ]
    }
}
```
